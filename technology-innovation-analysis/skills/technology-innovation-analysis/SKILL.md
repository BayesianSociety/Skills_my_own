name: technology-innovation-analysis
description: Evaluate whether a publicly traded company is an exceptional innovator and whether its core technologies are moving from science to commercialization. Use this skill whenever the user asks about innovation quality, breakthrough potential, commercialization readiness, R&D strength, patent/scientometric signals, technology adoption, or whether a company or ticker is an early winner in semiconductors, computing, databases, health, biotech, quantum, space, fintech, AI, or adjacent technology sectors, even if they do not explicitly ask for an "innovation analysis."

# Who you are
You are a scientist, an economist and an expert in innovation in organizations. You are very precise and quantitative. You pay attention to numbers.
You always cite sources at the end of every research for deep evaluations.

# Technology Innovation Analysis

Use this skill to analyze a public company as an innovator, not just as a financial asset. The goal is to distinguish scientific excitement from genuine industrial and commercial momentum.

## What this skill does

Build a disciplined, source-backed view of whether a company is:

- working on technologies with real breakthrough potential,
- translating science into patents, process know-how, and deployment,
- positioned to benefit if the technology scales commercially.

This skill is designed for company-level analysis once the user provides a company name, ticker, or CIK.
Use multi-agents to do the research.

## Core operating rules

1. Start with the company, ticker, or CIK and identify the technologies that matter most to the investment or innovation thesis.
2. Prefer quantitative evidence over narrative claims whenever the data exists.
3. Use scientometrics and patent analysis together. Neither is enough alone.
4. Treat industrialization and adoption as separate gates. A technology can be scientifically exciting and still be far from investable scale.
5. Be explicit about uncertainty. Do not overstate conclusions.
6. If a key fact is unclear or the user did not specify the company, stop and ask.

## Source standard

Use current, primary, and reputable sources. For anything time-sensitive, browse and verify rather than relying on memory.

Prioritize:

- use SEC.gov as a primary tool for search on companies,
- use the company's own websites when SEC.gov information is unavailable because the company is not from the US,
- public company primary materials: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, annual report, investor presentation, earnings call transcript, product announcements, regulatory filings,
- analyze a number of years, preferably 5 years back,
- major patent offices and patent databases,
- papers and research from renowned universities and institutes,
- standards bodies, regulators, and policy documents when relevant,
- high-quality industry sources only after primary evidence.

When using academic sources, strongly prefer renowned institutions such as:

- Stanford,
- Harvard including Belfer Center,
- MIT,
- Imperial College London,
- University of Sussex SPRU,
- University of Amsterdam,
- Leiden University,
- other globally respected universities with direct domain expertise.

Always cite the sources you actually used. You must distinguish sourced facts from your inference and indicate when that happens.
You do not stop at the first source with an answer and move on, you must check all the sources. Check all universities, all patent offices and all documents published by the company.
Also check documents for all the years for which you've been asked to do the research.

Provide numbers how the numbers of patents or patent families behaved over the last 5 years.
Provide numbers on how the numbers of articles realated to the technologies used by the company behaved over the last 5 years.

## Analysis workflow

### Step 1: Frame the company and the candidate technologies

Identify:

- the company’s core innovation domains,
- the specific products, platforms, or enabling technologies that matter,
- whether the thesis is about invention, commercialization, process leadership, ecosystem control, or adoption.

If the company spans multiple technology areas, focus on the 1 to 3 technologies most material to future value creation.

### Step 2: Build the 5-layer dashboard

Score each layer from 0 to 5. You must use evidence from the source list, not vibes.
Place layers one under another, do not put them side by side. 
You may reserve a right sidebar for operational snapshots, scoring rules explanations or other interpretations

#### Do:
Create a horizontal progress bar component for the dashboard. The bar should have a rounded rectangular track (light or muted background) and a filled portion indicating progress. The fill should extend proportionally based on a value (e.g., 60%) and use a contrasting accent color. Include a label on the left (e.g., “Science”) and a numeric indicator on the right (e.g., “3 / 5”). The bar should be thin (6–10px height), with fully rounded ends, smooth edges, and subtle contrast between filled and unfilled portions. Optionally include a soft glow or gradient on the filled section for a modern UI look.

#### Don't
Do not absolutely use large rounded corners on Vertical bars. They make the Vertical bars look like “pills,” which reduces accuracy and makes height comparisons harder.
Also avoid placing value labels in positions where they are visually overshadowed by the bars. Labels should be clearly readable, with strong contrast and proper separation from the chart elements.

#### Layer 1: Science

Assess whether the relevant field shows:

- publication growth,
- citation velocity and citation quality,
- cross-disciplinary expansion,
- concentration or diffusion across leading labs,
- novelty, coherence, and uncertainty.

Questions to answer:

- Is this field genuinely growing or just experiencing a one-off burst?
- Are leading papers coming from credible institutions?
- Is there evidence that the science is converging toward tractable applications?

#### Layer 2: IP

Assess:

- patent family growth,
- assignee quality,
- technical specificity,
- non-patent literature linkage,
- standards relevance where applicable.

Questions to answer:

- Are patent families rising over time?
- Are credible firms, universities, or labs involved?
- Is there visible linkage between science and patents?
- Are patents specific enough to indicate real engineering work?

#### Layer 3: Industrialization

Assess:

- pilot lines,
- manufacturing/process engineering activity,
- capex,
- yield, throughput, reliability, or installation commentary,
- hiring patterns that imply scaling and operations maturity.

Questions to answer:

- Is the company moving from research toward repeatable production?
- Are there signs of process learning?
- Is management discussing real operating constraints instead of only vision?

#### Layer 4: Adoption

Assess:

- customer trials,
- design wins,
- procurement commitments,
- ecosystem partnerships,
- deployment, bookings, or commercialization evidence.

Questions to answer:

- Are customers testing or buying?
- Are downstream partners building around this technology?
- Is the company winning adoption in a way that can compound?

#### Layer 5: Policy and Economics

Assess:

- subsidy or tax-credit alignment,
- export-control effects,
- reimbursement or procurement support,
- standards and regulatory fit,
- labor, supply chain, power, or infrastructure availability.

Questions to answer:

- Is the surrounding policy environment supportive, neutral, or hostile?
- Are there obvious economic bottlenecks to scale?
- Does the ecosystem required for scale exist or appear to be forming?

## Scoring rule

Score each layer 0 to 5, then total 0 to 25.

- 0 to 8: exploratory science
- 9 to 14: emerging technology worth monitoring
- 15 to 19: translational momentum
- 20 to 25: plausible breakthrough or scale-up candidate

Do not place a technology on the highest-priority list unless it scores at least 3 in both Industrialization and Adoption. This prevents confusing scientific excitement with commercial readiness.

## Formal scoring protocol

Use a deterministic scoring pass after the research and extraction pass. The model is responsible for gathering and structuring evidence. The scorer is responsible for converting structured evidence into reproducible scores.

When only a single company is available, compute an absolute readiness score only. Do not invent peer percentiles or pseudo-benchmarks from memory. In single-company mode:

- compute the absolute readiness score using the deterministic scorer,
- do not create an `absolute_score` object in `scored.json`,
- use the canonical top-level scored fields: `total_score`, `display_total_score`, `gate_pass`, `verdict`, and `layers`,
- leave `peer_score` unset unless a real peer benchmark exists,
- describe the result as a readiness score, not a relative ranking,
- keep the output benchmark-ready so peers can be added later without changing the schema.

### Required structured research payload

Before scoring, extract the research into a structured JSON payload that can later be inserted into SQLite or another deterministic store. The payload is the canonical record of what was found, what was unavailable, which judgments were made, and how raw observations became normalized metrics.

Save each research run as a separate artifact set so later runs for the same company do not overwrite earlier runs. Use this run-scoped folder:

- `public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/payload.json`
- `public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/scored.json`
- `public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/dashboard.html`

Use ISO dates for `research_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and a filesystem-safe `run_id` that can distinguish multiple runs on the same day. Use stable key names, stable ordering where practical, ISO dates, and ASCII-safe JSON so content hashes remain meaningful across runs.

Use this broad shape:

Rules for extraction:

- `value` must be normalized to `0..1` before entering the deterministic scorer.
- `weight` values within each layer must sum to `1.0`.
- `coverage_ratio` must also be on `0..1` and reflect how much of the required layer evidence was verified from primary or acceptable secondary sources.
- distinguish company-attributable metrics from field-level proxies; field proxies are allowed only when company-level data is unavailable and must be stated as such.
- caps are for explicit red flags only. Do not use them to hide weak evidence behind prose.
- every metric should include `evidence_ids` that point to one or more records in `evidence_items`; if no direct evidence exists, state the gap in `missing`, lower `coverage_ratio`, and add a `judgment_calls` entry.
- every normalized metric should include the raw inputs, normalization method, parameters, rationale, and judgment level. This makes the non-deterministic research step auditable even though the scoring step is deterministic.
- every source used for a metric, red flag, source-availability claim, or major thesis judgment should appear in `sources`. Do not rely on untracked links in prose.
- record source availability, search behavior, exclusions, and judgment calls explicitly. Web research is not deterministic; the payload must preserve enough context for a later reviewer to understand why this evidence set was used.
- use `skill_metadata` and `research_run` on every payload. Increment `skill_version`, `scorer_version`, or `metric_rules_version` when their behavior or schema changes materially.
- keep the payload broad enough to store failed searches and partial evidence. A missing clean patent-family census, unavailable filing, paywalled source, or ambiguous assignee mapping is part of the evidence state, not an implementation detail to omit.

Rules for dashboard-visible content:

- For `schema_version` 2.1 and later, include `dashboard_content` and `claims`. These fields make the JSON as informative as the dashboard HTML.
- The HTML dashboard should render all substantive company-specific text from `*_scored.json`. Keep only generic interface labels, CSS, JavaScript control text, and repeated component labels hard-coded in HTML.
- Every substantive section used in prior dashboards must have a JSON home when it appears: hero, thesis, technology map, five-layer dashboard, quantitative signals or charts, commercialization evidence, breakthrough gate, university research signals, patent signals, red flags, watchlist or view-change triggers, operational snapshot, scoring rule or method notes, bottom line, and sources.
- Every research claim displayed in HTML should appear once in `claims[]` or inside a `dashboard_content` item with linked `claim_ids`. Use `claim_type` to distinguish `sourced_fact`, `inference`, `limitation`, `forecast`, and `monitoring_trigger`.
- Every displayed red flag should appear in `dashboard_content.red_flags[]`, even if the same risk also appears as a scoring cap or layer limitation.
- Every displayed watchlist item or "what would change the view" trigger should appear in `dashboard_content.watchlist`.
- Every displayed university, lab, or field research signal should appear in `dashboard_content.university_research_signals.institutions[]`, with `company_attributable` and `field_proxy` flags.
- Every displayed representative patent or family should appear in `dashboard_content.patent_signals.families[]`, with jurisdictions and source links where available.
- Commercialization or operational evidence displayed outside the layer cards should appear in `dashboard_content.commercialization_evidence` or `dashboard_content.operational_snapshot`, not only as prose embedded in the HTML.
- Section text may summarize multiple evidence records, but it should still link to supporting `evidence_ids`, `source_ids`, or `claim_ids`. If the support is indirect or incomplete, state that in the item text or in `method_notes`.
- If the repo contains `Story_prompt.txt`, the story workflow is mandatory for every dashboard produced with this skill. First render a base `dashboard.html` from scorer-produced `scored.json` without a story section. Then execute the unchanged `Story_prompt.txt` against that base `dashboard.html`. The prompt must produce four run-scoped story files from the same base dashboard content: `story.md` for the original story, `story.basic.md` for a reader who needs simple, almost basic explanation, `story.informed.md` for a reader who already knows something about the technology, and `story.expert.md` for a reader who is already expert in the technology.
- Insert all four story files into `payload.json` under `dashboard_content.story`, using `original`, `variants.basic`, `variants.informed`, `variants.expert`, and `default_variant`. Preserve `story.md` as the original story; do not overwrite it when creating variants. `original.body_markdown` must equal the exact contents of `story.md`; each variant `body_markdown` must equal the exact contents of its corresponding variant file. Rerun the deterministic scorer so `scored.json.dashboard_content.story` is preserved, and rerender the final `dashboard.html` with the original story shown near the end of the dashboard by default.
- Store the story only through the existing payload/scored JSON path. Do not add Storage System tables or importer logic for this workflow. The JavaScript storage system will ingest the story through `analysis_runs.raw_payload_json` and `analysis_runs.raw_scored_json`.
- Render the story section from `data.dashboard_content.story`, not from hard-coded prose in the HTML template. Add three buttons directly above the story text: Basic, Informed, and Expert. These buttons must not call an LLM or any external API from the browser; they only switch the displayed embedded story variant. Prefer `paragraphs[]` for escaped HTML rendering and keep `body_markdown` as the exact markdown content for each story.
- A run is incomplete if `payload.json`, `scored.json`, or the embedded JSON in final `dashboard.html` is missing any of `dashboard_content.story.original`, `dashboard_content.story.variants.basic`, `dashboard_content.story.variants.informed`, or `dashboard_content.story.variants.expert`.

### Deterministic layer formula

For each layer, compute:

`layer_score = 5 * confidence_penalty * sum(weight_i * metric_i_value)`

Where:

- `metric_i_value` is normalized to `0..1`,
- `sum(weight_i)` must equal `1.0`,
- `confidence_penalty = 0.6 + 0.4 * coverage_ratio`,
- any active red-flag cap is applied after the score is calculated.

The deterministic scorer should return, for every layer:

- `score`,
- `raw_score`,
- `coverage_ratio`,
- `confidence_penalty`,
- `confidence`,
- `cap_reasons`.

### Deterministic support files

Keep the deterministic implementation split into two files inside this skill folder:

- `technology-innovation-analysis/metric_rules.py`
- `technology-innovation-analysis/score_innovation_benchmark.py`

Responsibilities:

- `metric_rules.py` holds reusable rules, validation, normalization helpers, confidence logic, and verdict mapping.
- `score_innovation_benchmark.py` reads the structured payload, applies the rules, computes scores, preserves `dashboard_content` and `claims`, and emits scored JSON.

Use the normalization helpers from `metric_rules.py` when converting raw research observations into `0..1` metric values. Preferred helpers:

- `normalize_min_max(value, floor, cap)`
- `normalize_log(value, cap)`
- `normalize_growth(start_value, end_value, years, floor, cap)`

If a metric cannot be normalized with a documented rule, state the rule explicitly before scoring. Do not silently invent a scale.

### Confidence and gate rules

Use these confidence labels by default:

- `High` if `coverage_ratio >= 0.85`
- `Medium` if `0.65 <= coverage_ratio < 0.85`
- `Low` if `coverage_ratio < 0.65`

The breakthrough gate is passed only if:

- `Industrialization >= 3.0`,
- `Adoption >= 3.0`,
- `Industrialization confidence_penalty >= 0.8`,
- `Adoption confidence_penalty >= 0.8`.

### Verdict mapping

Use the deterministic total to map to the overall verdict:

- `0 to 8`: scientifically interesting but early
- `9 to 14`: emerging innovator worth monitoring
- `15 to 19`: strong innovator with translational momentum
- `20 to 25`: exceptional innovator and plausible scale-up candidate

### Implementation requirement

Use the deterministic scorer at `technology-innovation-analysis/score_innovation_benchmark.py` whenever the dashboard includes a numeric score. Do not hard-code `score_total`, `total_score`, `absolute_score`, per-layer `score`, verdict totals, gate results, or substantive company-specific dashboard prose directly into dashboard generators if the data can be routed through the scorer.

`scored.json` is a generated artifact owned by `score_innovation_benchmark.py`.

Do not write, construct, patch, or manually synthesize `scored.json` in dashboard scripts. Dashboard scripts may write `payload.json` and `dashboard.html`, but they must read score, verdict, layers, claims, and dashboard content from scorer-produced `scored.json`.

The only approved command shape for producing scored output is:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/technology-innovation-analysis/score_innovation_benchmark.py public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/payload.json -o public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/scored.json
```

If the deterministic scorer fails validation, stop and fix `payload.json`. Do not work around the failure by manually creating a simplified score object.

Common validation failures must be fixed in the payload:

- missing `claims[]`,
- missing required `dashboard_content` sections,
- metric names that do not match `metric_rules.py`,
- missing `evidence_ids`,
- weights that do not sum to `1.0`,
- normalized metric values outside `0..1`.

Before finalizing a run, verify by static file inspection only. Do not use Playwright, browser automation, screenshots, or `networkidle` for this verification unless the user explicitly asks for visual testing.

1. `score_innovation_benchmark.py payload.json -o scored.json` exits successfully.
2. `scored.json` contains top-level `total_score`, `display_total_score`, `gate_pass`, `verdict`, `layers`, and `scorer_metadata`.
3. `scored.json` does not use a nested score object such as `absolute_score.total`.
4. `dashboard.html` embeds scorer-produced `scored.json` in `<script id="scored-data" type="application/json">...</script>` and contains code or markup that reads company-specific score and prose from the embedded JSON, not from duplicated hard-coded constants.
5. If `Story_prompt.txt` exists, parse `payload.json`, `scored.json`, and the embedded dashboard JSON from `dashboard.html` and confirm they contain `dashboard_content.story.original` plus `variants.basic`, `variants.informed`, and `variants.expert`.
6. If `Story_prompt.txt` exists, confirm by static text search that `dashboard.html` contains the button labels `Basic`, `Informed`, and `Expert`.

When generating HTML, use this rule of thumb:

- hard-coded HTML is acceptable for generic UI labels such as "Score", "Sources", "Confidence", "Upgrade", or "Downgrade",
- `*_scored.json` should provide company-specific displayed text such as conclusions, evidence summaries, chart captions, commercialization claims, university lists, patent interpretations, red flags, watchlist triggers, method limitations, and bottom-line verdict explanation.

If a dashboard generator lives outside this skill folder, do not edit it from inside this skill package unless the user explicitly asks for cross-folder changes. This skill package should remain self-contained by default:

- methodology in `technology-innovation-analysis/SKILL.md`,
- reusable deterministic rules in `technology-innovation-analysis/metric_rules.py`,
- deterministic scorer in `technology-innovation-analysis/score_innovation_benchmark.py`,
- evaluation assets in `technology-innovation-analysis/evals/`.

## Breakthrough gate

Before calling a technology a serious near-term breakthrough candidate, confirm most of the following:

- novelty, growth, coherence, impact potential, and uncertainty are all visible in the field,
- publication and citation growth are persistent rather than one-off,
- patent families are rising with credible assignees,
- patent-to-science linkage is visible,
- university-industry-government interaction is visible,
- a functioning innovation ecosystem exists or is forming,
- process engineering and production learning have started,
- public disclosures show capex, yields, bookings, deployments, or revenue,
- regulatory and standards conditions are not fatally misaligned.

If most of these are not true, the technology may still matter, but it is too early to label it a likely near-term industrial breakthrough.

## Red flags
This is extremely important! Do not neglect or undermine this part. Think extra long and do extensive search on this part.

Downgrade confidence when you see:

- rapid paper growth without serious patenting,
- vague or low-specificity patents,
- company storytelling without yields, installations, production metrics, or revenue,
- no complementors or ecosystem partners,
- dependence on one celebrity lab or one flagship startup,
- absent standards or regulatory pathway,
- extreme manufacturing requirements without a supplier base.

## Quantitative emphasis

Use as many quantitative methods as the source base allows. Examples:

- publication growth rates,
- citation acceleration,
- concentration metrics across leading labs or assignees,
- patent family counts and growth,
- non-patent literature linkage,
- capex trends,
- disclosed backlog, bookings, deployments, units, installed base, or utilization,
- hiring signals that imply transition from science to operations,
- time-series comparisons across peers.

If the data is too sparse for a robust metric, say so directly instead of forcing a number.

## Recommended cadence

If the user wants an ongoing watchlist, recommend:

- monthly: refresh publication, citation, and patent trends,
- quarterly: review filings, earnings calls, partnerships, capex, and scorecards,
- every 6 months: rebuild field maps, compare leading labs with leading assignees, refresh the watchlist, and remove technologies that remain scientifically interesting but industrially stagnant.

## Output format

Use this structure unless the user asks for a different format:

### Company Innovation Assessment

#### 1. Thesis in 3 to 5 bullets

State the main conclusion, the technologies that matter, and the current innovation stage.

#### 2. Technology map

List the company’s key technologies and explain which ones are central to the thesis.

#### 3. Five-layer dashboard

For each layer:

- score from 0 to 5,
- evidence summary,
- what is strong,
- what is missing,
- confidence level.

#### 4. Breakthrough gate check

State which conditions are met, which are not, and why.

#### 5. List university research 

List which universities are researching this technology 

#### 6. List patents

List patents or patent families related to that technology, and which patent offices are involved.

#### 7. Red flags

List concrete reasons for caution.

#### 8. Overall verdict

Choose one:

- not innovative enough,
- scientifically interesting but early,
- emerging innovator worth monitoring,
- strong innovator with translational momentum,
- exceptional innovator and plausible scale-up candidate.

#### 9. What would change the view

List the next data points that would upgrade or downgrade the thesis.

#### 10. Sources

Provide a clean list of cited sources with links when available.

## Writing guidance

- Be skeptical and precise.
- Quote carefully and sparingly.
- Separate fact from interpretation.
- Avoid broad claims such as "this will be the next breakthrough" unless the evidence is unusually strong.
- If the company has little credible evidence, say that clearly.

## Example triggers

- "Analyze whether ASML is still an exceptional innovator or mostly a beneficiary of industry structure."
- "Use scientometrics and patents to assess whether IonQ has real breakthrough potential."
- "I want a framework-driven view on whether this biotech is genuinely innovative or just promotional."

# Final artefact

Save the final artefact in the current repo under the run-scoped folder:

`public/runs/{company_slug}/{research_date}/{run_id}/dashboard.html`

Use the same `company_slug`, `research_date`, and `run_id` as the payload and scored JSON for that research run.

The dashboard.html must be self-contained. Embed the full scorer-produced scored.json in a
<script id="scored-data" type="application/json">...</script> block and render from that embedded JSON.
Do not use fetch("scored.json"), XMLHttpRequest, or any runtime load of local JSON files.
